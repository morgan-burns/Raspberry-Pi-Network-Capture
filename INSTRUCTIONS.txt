For this you will need a raspberry pi and a USB ethernet adapter.
All lines with # are commands. 

You will need to make sure that a few prerequisits are installed:

Apache and PHP

#sudo apt-get update
#sudo apt-get upgrade
#sudo apt-get autoremove

REBOOT Pi
#sudo reload

#sudo apt-get -y install apache2 libapache2-mod-php

Go to your Pi IP and make sure you get the default page.

Now go to /var/www/html and remove the index.html file
#sudo rm index.html

Make an index.php file and make sure PHP works
#sudo nano index.php

In the file put 
<?
phpinfo();
?>

Now go to Pi IP

Copy the web files directory to /var/www/html

Now we need to give the current user (pi) permission to use TCPDump

#sudo groupadd pcap
#sudo usermod -a -G pcap pi
#sudo chgrp pcap /usr/sbin/tcpdump
#sudo chmod 750 /usr/sbin/tcpdump
#sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip /usr/sbin/tcpdump

Now if you open your browser and navigate to pi IP you should get two buttons. Start and Stop.

Click on start 

Wait a few seconds and then click on Stop

Click on the link to go to FileList

You should see a PCAP file in there. 

Click on the PCAP file to download and analyse with wireshark.
